% INPUTS:
% A                     Matrix. fThis function takes as an input a 
% network adjacency matrix A, for a network that is undirected. If you
% provide a network that is directed, this code is going to make it
% undirected before continuing. Since link weights will not affect
% component sizes, weighted and unweighted networks work equally well. You
% may provide a "full" or a "sparse" matrix.
%
% OUTPUTS:
% nClusters             INT - The number of clusters in the network.
% sizes                 vector<INT> - a vector of cluster sizes.
% members               cell<vector<INT>> a cell array of vectors, each
%   entry of which is a membership list for that component.
% idxLargestCluster     INT - the index of the largest cluster in the SIZES
%   and MEMBERS outputs.
%
% Example: (uncomment and copy and paste into MATLAB command window)
% % Generate a 1000 node network adjacency matrix, A
% A = floor(1.0015*rand(1000,1000)); A=A+A'; A(A==2)=1;
% % Call networkComponents function
% [nClusters,sizes,members,idxLargestCluster] = networkComponents(A);
% % get the size of the largest component
% sizeLC = sizes(idxLargestCluster);
% % get a network adjacency matrix for ONLY the largets component
% LC = A(members{idxLargestCluster},members{idxLargestCluster});

function [nClusters,clusterSizes,members,idxLargestCluster] = networkComponents(A)

N = size(A,1);
% Remove diagonals

% Have we visited a particular node yet?

            nbrs = find(A(:,members{end}(ptr)));

            newNbrs = nbrs(isDiscovered(nbrs)==0);
            % we can now mark them as discovered
