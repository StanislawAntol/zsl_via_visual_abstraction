==========================

Code for the ECCV 2014 paper "Zero-Shot Learning via Visual Abstraction" by Stanislaw Antol, Larry Zitnick, and Devi Parikh. The project webpage can be found [here](https://computing.ece.vt.edu/~santol/projects/zsl_via_visual_abstraction/).

Everything can be fun from the (anonymized) AMT files. These files are located [here](https://computing.ece.vt.edu/~santol/projects/zsl_via_visual_abstraction/input_files.zip).
